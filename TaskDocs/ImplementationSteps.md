# Implementation Steps 

<ol>
    <li>
        Fork the repo in your GitHub account.
    </li>
    <li>
        Other teammates should fork the forked repo form teammateâ€™s account <i>(in case of you are a team and you will not do it individually).</i>
    </li>
    <li>
        every single team member should type code in his forked repo in this account then merge his solution with the first fork <i>(in case of you are a team and you will not do it individually).</i>
    </li>
    <li>
        Create you own "README.md" file to make GitHub display it in the repository home page instead of displaying "TaskReadMeFile.md".
    </li>
    <li>
        Please keep a head with the main task repository to and if there exists changes in the main repository after you have forked it, just pull these changes and everything will be updated automatically, and before pulling main stream codebase updates save "README" file in another temporary place to aovid overwritting it's content.
    </li>
     <li>
        Please don't edit files that exists in "TaskDocs" directory and pull main stream edits instead if there exists updates.
    </li>
</ol>

Have fun !!!
